- Use default mapping on deluge.
- Use MidiFighter Twister Utility to open the mapping file, transfer it to the device or change controls midi channels.
- If there are any problems try MF Twister Firmware 02.Oct.2019 (current firmware was not working for me but forgot why :) 
- Used System channel for switching bank pages: 16 (default was: 4)
  -> Change banks via push encoder buttons in top row
- Encoder channel for cc-params: 10
- Button commands in the two bottom rows channel:11 - are mapped for same behaviour on all 4 banks
- Sorted mappable parmeters like the deluge layout if possible
